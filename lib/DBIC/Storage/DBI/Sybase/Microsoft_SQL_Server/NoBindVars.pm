=head1 NAME

DBIC::Storage::DBI::Sybase::Microsoft_SQL_Server::NoBindVars - Support for Microsoft
SQL Server via DBD::Sybase without placeholders

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This subclass supports MSSQL server connections via DBD::Sybase when ? style
placeholders are not available.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you are using this driver then your combination of L<DBD::Sybase> and
libraries (most likely FreeTDS) does not support ? style placeholders.

This storage driver uses L<DBIC::Storage::DBI::NoBindVars> as a base.
This means that bind variables will be interpolated (properly quoted of course)
into the SQL query itself, without using bind placeholders.

More importantly this means that caching of prepared statements is explicitly
disabled, as the interpolation renders it useless.

In all other respects, it is a subclass of
L<DBIC::Storage::DBI::Sybase::Microsoft_SQL_Server>.
